## 😄 Question 1: The Mysterious Loop

**You're in for a treat! Dive into this JavaScript adventure and solve the mystery of the loop.** 🕵️

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  }, 100);
}

```
Options:


A. 🤨 0 1 2 3 4

B. 🤣 5 5 5 5 5

C. 😅 1 2 3 4 5

D. 😇 None of the above

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The correct answer is option B. The output will be "5" printed five times because JavaScript loves surprises!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
In this code, JavaScript plays a little prank with closures. The setTimeout function captures the variable `i`, and it decides to shout "5" five times after the loop's done. Sneaky, isn't it? 🙃
</details>

## 😄 Question 2: The Null and Undefined Showdown

**Get ready for the ultimate showdown: `null` vs. `undefined`! Who's who in the JavaScript world?** 🤼‍♂️

Options:

A. 🤔 `null` is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

B. 😇 `undefined` is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

C. 🤣 `null` is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

D. 😅 `undefined` is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The correct answer is option C. `null` plays the part of representing the intentional absence of any object value, while `undefined` is the variable that's just not quite sure what's going on.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
In the world of JavaScript, `null` is the actor who says, "I intentionally have no value!" while `undefined` is the character who's like, "Wait, did I miss something? 🤷‍♂️"
</details>



## 😄 Question 3: The Map-a-Palooza

**It's time to uncover the magic of the `map` function in arrays! Get ready for a fun ride. 🎢**

Options:

A. 🙅‍♂️ To remove elements from an array.

B. 🙉 To add elements to the beginning of an array.

C. 🚀 To create a new array by applying a provided function to each element of an existing array.

D. 🧐 To find the maximum value in an array.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The correct answer is option C. The `map` function is like a superhero that creates a brand-new array by working its magic on each element of an existing array.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
Imagine the `map` function as a fantastic painter. It takes your old array and transforms it into a brand-new masterpiece using a special formula for each element. Voilà! It's like art for arrays. 🎨🤩
</details>



## 😄 Question 4: The Hunt for Primitives

**Time for a primitive data type adventure! Can you spot the odd one out in the JavaScript world?** 🕵️‍♂️

Options:

A. 🧶 String

B. 🚀 Object

C. 🎉 Boolean

<summary>Answer</summary>
The correct answer is option B. "Object" is the party crasher here; it's not a primitive data type in JavaScript.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
In the realm of JavaScript, primitive data types are like the cool kids at the playground: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, and Symbol. Objects, on the other hand, are more like the grown-ups, with their own rules and fancy properties. 🧶🕴️
</details>



## 😄 Question 5: The Great Array Adventure

**Get ready for an epic array adventure! What happens when arrays collide in JavaScript?** 🦸‍♂️

```javascript

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The correct answer is option D. It's a magical show, and the order is not guaranteed; it depends on the execution time of promises.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
In the world of asynchronous JavaScript, promises are like magic spells. The order of their execution depends on the promises' mood and how fast they can perform their tricks. It's all about timing! 🌠✨

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The correct answer is option A. It's "global" all the way in the world of JavaScript scope!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
In this tricky scenario, there's a global `scopeVar` and a local `scopeVar`. However, the local one doesn't affect the global one, and the function returns the global "scopeVar." No surprises this time! 🔍🎩🌐
</details>

## 😄 Question 10: The Enigmatic Callback

**Get ready to decipher the world of JavaScript callbacks! Can you predict the outcome?** 🧩

```javascript
function performMagic(callback) {

const arrowFunction = () => {
  return this;
};

function regularFunction() {
  return this;
}

const mysteryObject = {
  key1: arrowFunction(),
  key2: regularFunction(),
};

console.log(mysteryObject.key1 === mysteryObject.key2);
```
Options:

A. 😅 true

B. 🤯 false

C. 🏹 It throws a "this" party.

D. 🎉 undefined

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The correct answer is option B. It's a mystery - `false` is the outcome!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
In the world of JavaScript, arrow functions and regular functions handle the `this` keyword differently. Arrow functions don't have their own `this` context, while regular functions do. In this mystery, they're not equal! 🤷‍♂️🔍🏹
</details>

## 😄 Question 12: The Infinity Conundrum

**Time to tackle an infinity riddle in JavaScript! Are you ready for the challenge?** 🌌

```javascript
const infinityMath = Math.pow(2, 1023) * 2;

const isInfinity = Number.isFinite(infinityMath);

console.log(isInfinity);
```
Options:

A. 🌌 false

B. 🤯 true

C. 😄 NaN

D. 🚀 It creates a black hole in your console.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The correct answer is option A. It's not a black hole; it's `false` because `infinityMath` is indeed `Infinity`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
In this JavaScript universe, we're dealing with incredibly large numbers. `Number.isFinite` checks if a number is finite or not. Despite the large value, it's `Infinity`, which is not a finite number. No black holes here! 🪐🔭🌌
